## Requirements
 - [BepinEx 5](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.4.21)
 - Latest legit version of Receiver 2
 - Latest release of the [modding kit](https://github.com/Szikaka-97/Receiver2ModdingKit) (YOU ABSOLUTELY NEED THE LATEST VERSION OTHERWISE THE MAGAZINES WONT APPEAR IN THE DEBUG MENU AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA)
## Download & Installation
(You can watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xe5f_CwQQVo) video guide in case something isn't clear)  							
 - Download the files in the releases section.<br />
 - Extract the .zip file somewhere.
 - Launch the game with the modding kit DLL installed.
 - Go into setting and click on the "Install" button.
 - Navigate to where you extracted the .zip file
 - After clicking the prompt to install the gun, restart the game. <br />
 <br />**Alternatively, if you prefer the manual method:**
 - Copy the file called _"SR25_Files"_ in **SR25_(OS).rar** to <br />
 `%UserProfile%\AppData\LocalLow\Wolfire Games\Receiver2\Guns` - Windows <br />
 `~/Library/Application Support/Wolfire Games/Receiver2/Guns` – Mac OS<br />
 `~/.config_unity3d/Wolfire Games/Receiver2/Guns` – Linux <br />
 - Copy the file called _"SR25_plugin"_ in **SR25_(OS).rar** to (where you have R2 installed) **Receiver 2\BepinEx\plugins**
 ## Usage & Features
 - Go to the debug menu, and start the custom campaign, or go to the debug menu and spawn the gun + ammo in.
 - Pressing the hammer key opens/closes the dust cover when not aiming the gun.
 - When aiming the gun, press the hammer key to switch between the two sights.
 - The scope is zeroed to about 40 meters (131.234 feet).
 - The backup reflex sight is zeroed to 20m (131.234/2 feet, you do the math).
 - There's no catch whatsoever, originally wanted to see if giving a scope the same post-processing that the game has was possible
